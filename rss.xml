            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Alzheimer's preventative drug hope - BBC News</h1><p>Scientists have detected a number of drugs which could help protect against Alzheimer's disease, acting like statins for the brain.

            <title><![CDATA[Labour's McDonnell]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Labour's McDonnell</h1><p>considers giving workers right to buy firms 4 hours ago  From the section UK Politics Image copyrightReuters A Labour government could give employees the right to take over their companies if they are sold, dissolved or floated on the stock market. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the party does not want to return to an era of widespread state ownership. Instead, Labour would look to expand co-operatives and explore giving workers the "right to own". David Cameron has accused Labour of wanting to turn back the clock to the days of state ownership and strikes. But Mr McDonnell tackled this claim head-on in a speech in Manchester, saying Labour had to move on from its traditional belief that state ownership was always the answer. "Whatever the achievements of the past, we cannot simply turn the clock back - whether to 1997, 1964, or 1945," he said.</p></article>]]></description>
